## OpenPDroid for Cyanogenmod 11 M6 


See discussion [here](https://github.com/OpenPDroid/OpenPDroidPatches/issues/21).


## OpenPdroid v1.0.1 for Android 4.4


These are the current build patches for Android 4.4 and should generally reflect the current state of the **android-4.4_r1-openpdroid** branch. I made the switch back to creating patches off of tags with Android 4.3, now the naming reflects that. If a tag comes out that significantly breaks the patches, then a new branch will be created.

The latest commits are not always reflected in the build patches, bleeding-edge development is in the _-devel_ branches. Bleeding edge development is coming slowly these days, no one realizes this more than me. If you think community driven security is a good thing, you are encouraged to contribute.

There are ```apply``` and ```remove``` patch scripts available that I personally use over at [my personal github page](https://github.com/mateor/patchScripts). A couple of those scripts also create [auto-patcher](https://www.github.com/mateor/auto-patcher) patches, but the apply/remove scripts could be helpful to anyone reading this.

__These build patches should work for most roms. I try and maintain them to apply cleanly to almost all AOSP-derived firmware (CyanogenMod, AOKP, ParanoidAndroid, SlimRom, etc.)


To Apply
--------------
	cd ~/android/system/build; git checkout -b openpdroid; patch -p1 < ~/openpdroid_4.3_build.patch
	cd ~/android/system/libcore; git checkout -b openpdroid; patch -p1 < ~/openpdroid_4.3_libcore.patch
	cd ~/android/system/packages/apps/Mms; git checkout -b openpdroid; patch -p1 < ~/openpdroid_4.3_packages_apps_Mms.patch
	cd ~/android/system/frameworks/base; git checkout -b openpdroid; patch -p1 < ~/openpdroid_4.3_frameworks_base.patch
	cd ~/android/system/frameworks/opt/telephony; git checkout -b openpdroid; patch -p1 < ~/openpdroid_4.3_frameworks_opt_telephony.patch
	cd ~/android/system; . build/envsetup.sh; brunch <DEVICE_TARGET>


To Remove
--------------
	cd ~/android/system; rm -rf out/target/common/obj/JAVA_LIBRARIES/framework_intermediates out/host/common/obj/JAVA_LIBRARIES/layoutlib_intermediates out/target/common/obj/JAVA_LIBRARIES/telephony-common_intermediates out/target/common/obj/APPS/Mms_intermediates out/target/common/obj/JAVA_LIBRARIES/services_intermediates

**[OR]** 	cd ~/android; make clobber

**and** to reset your source tree**

	cd ~/android/system/build; git checkout . ; git clean -df
	cd ~/android/system/libcore; git checkout . ; git clean -df
	cd ~/android/system/frameworks/base; git checkout . ; git clean -df
	cd ~/android/system/frameworks/opt/telephony; git checkout . ; git clean -df
	cd ~/android/system/packages/apps/Mms; git checkout . ; git clean -df
	cd ~/android/system; repo abandon openpdroid

If OpenPDroid intrigues you, yet the thought of applying all these patches gives you
pause, there is a tool that can attempt to patch the framework of an already compiled
rom called [The Auto-Patcher](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?p=32155918#post32155918).
